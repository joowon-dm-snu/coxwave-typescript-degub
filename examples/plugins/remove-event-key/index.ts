 * This is an example plugin that enriches all events by removing `event.time` from all events.

 * The device clock can be easily manipulated yielding events having unreasonable time values.
 * With `event.time` being `undefined`, the time of the event is determined when the event was sent
 * successfully by the browser ("Client Upload Time"), determined by the server clock, rather than
 * when the event actually occurred. On majority of the cases, "Client Upload Time" can be
 * off by up to the configured `config.flushIntervalMillis`. By default `config.flushIntervalMillis`
 * is set to 1000 milliseconds. In rare cases where initial request to Amplitude fails due to
 * bad payload, throttled request, server error, etc, the time difference can be extended.
